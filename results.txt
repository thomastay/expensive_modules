C++ took ~12s on test_big_sparse.in
F# took ~58s on test_big_sparse.in

Update: with basically a total rewrite to imperative style, F# got down to 6.6s on test_big_sparse.in. C++ now takes ~8s (this is on Windows).
Bear in mind the C++ is not as optimized.
As I expected, the thing that takes the most time is merging the sorted lists. Optimizing this will make the code much faster.
